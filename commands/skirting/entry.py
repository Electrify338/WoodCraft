"""Skirting — the plinth that closes the gap under an assembled kitchen.

Deliberately NOT part of the Countertop command: a worktop is referenced off the
WALL behind the cabinets, a plinth off the cabinet FRONTS, and forcing one dialog to
ask for both references made neither read clearly.

What you select
---------------
    Front faces        one per run — the front face of an end panel, or of any
                       cabinet in that run. This is the reference: its plane is the
                       front of the run and its normal says which way the run faces.
                       Picking it rather than inferring it is what lets a run be at
                       any angle and removes the guesswork over which end of a
                       symmetric side panel is the front.
    Run side panels    the side panels of the END cabinets of each run. They only
                       supply two things: how far the run reaches along its own
                       direction, and how high the underside of the carcass sits.
    Island side panels the same, for a cabinet block that gets skirting all the way
                       ROUND rather than across the front. Separate input because
                       an island is a different shape of answer, not a different
                       setting — and one command run can do both.
    Ground             optional. Any planar face or construction plane; its height
                       is the floor. Left empty, the floor is Z = 0.

and two numbers: the board's `thickness`, and its `setback` from the front of the
cabinets — the toe recess.

What it builds
--------------
One component per run ('Skirting', 'Skirting 2' …). Inside it, one sub-component per
physical length of board, because a 4.5 m run is not one piece: anything longer than
skirting_geom.MAX_PIECE_CM (3 m) is divided into equal lengths, and each piece is its
own component so the cut list counts it as a real part rather than as one impossible
board.

Corners are MITRED. The maths lives in commands/skirting_geom.py, which offsets the
run lines and intersects them, so an L, a U and a closed island loop all come out of
one construction — and the material at a corner is counted once, not twice.

Shapes it handles
-----------------
A straight run is one segment. An L or a U is two or three segments that meet, found
by intersecting their front lines near their ends and chained automatically, so you
select all the end panels and all the front faces in one go. A galley — two parallel
runs facing each other — deliberately does NOT chain: parallel lines never meet, so
each gets its own skirting. An island is a closed loop of four mitred sides.
