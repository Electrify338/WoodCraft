"""Engine for the Appearance Config command: scan, classify, build, verify.

Ports a workflow proven by hand on 7+ cabinets and an 18-cabinet kitchen
(4864 cells) into add-in code. The moving parts:

  scan()               walk the tree, classify every candidate occurrence
                       (attribute role → category → name keywords), descend
                       zero-body wrappers, apply user overrides, resolve
                       'front' roles by the single-door rule. Read-only.
  appearance_status()  which scheme appearances the design already has and
                       where the missing ones could come from. Read-only.
  apply_plan()         the builder AND the fix pass (one code path — the sweep
                       is the builder: it adds whatever columns/rows are
                       missing and fills whatever cells are empty or wrong).
  verify()             read-only cell sweep → empty / wrong counts.
  preview()/restore()  point the active configuration at a chosen appearance
                       row for a visual check, then put it back.
  open_source_document()  last-resort cloud fetch of the appearance source
                       doc, with a time-budget breaker (cloud calls BLOCK when
                       offline — same trap as Component.partNumber).

Rules baked in (do not renegotiate — they encode real Fusion API bugs and
user decisions):
  * The ROOT cell of every row stays EMPTY in an assembly: the root is the
    whole kitchen, and an appearance there tints appliances, sink, window
    glass and the room shell.
  * Never create or touch a table named like 'Shelves' (suppress columns are
    UI-only; an API-built Shelves table is always incomplete).
  * Appearances are matched by their LEADING CODE, never the full name
    (library copies are UPPERCASE and one is mojibaked).
  * Column titles are leaf occurrence names and repeat across cabinets, so
    the column↔occurrence mapping is persisted as a JSON attribute on the
    root component (config.WC_APPEARANCE_COLS) and re-derived by ordered
    alignment for tables built before this command existed.
