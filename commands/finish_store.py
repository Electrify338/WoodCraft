"""Which materials and appearances Set Finish offers — a global JSON list store.

Set Finish used to fill its dropdowns from Fusion's Favorites library, which meant
one shared shortlist for four different questions. A carcass is made of MDF or
melamine; a door front is a decor. Offering the same list for both is noise, so each
of the four dropdowns now has its OWN curated list of names, kept here:

    carcass_material    door_material       — physical materials
    carcass_appearance  door_appearance     — appearances

The file stores NAMES, not material objects, because that is what survives a library
being reloaded, re-imported or updated: the name is the stable handle a cabinetmaker
actually thinks in. Resolving a name to a live Fusion object is the job of
commands/material_pool.py — deliberately not this module, which stays pure Python so
it can be reasoned about and tested without Fusion.

`libraries` narrows where those names are looked up. Empty (the default) means every
loaded material library, which is what makes 'MDF' (Assets Library) and
'MFC - Melamine Face Chipboard' (Favorites Library) resolve alongside the Emaar
Library decors without anyone configuring anything. Narrow it later if two libraries
start disagreeing about a name.

Lives next to settings.json and the stock-sheet library (sheets_store.library_dir())
so all WoodCraft user data travels together. Edited in Fusion by the Finish Lists
command; hand-editable too, and malformed content degrades to the defaults rather
than raising.
