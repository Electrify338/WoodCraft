"""Shared component collection for WoodCraft output commands (Cut List, BOM, Inspect).

Components are collected by their WoodCraft *category* attribute (config.WC_CATEGORY
— 'panel' or 'hardware'); there is no geometry guessing, so panels and purchased
items never get mixed up. Collection walks the occurrence tree (root.occurrences →
childOccurrences) so it reaches items inside referenced cabinets, records ONE
instance per occurrence (so the piece count is real), and remembers each item's
immediate parent assembly (the cabinet it lives in) so reports can tell apart
same-named panels — every cabinet has a "Left Panel".
