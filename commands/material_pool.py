"""Turning the names in finish_store into live Fusion materials and appearances.

The split of responsibilities: finish_store.py owns WHICH names are offered (pure
Python, testable, hand-editable JSON); this module owns FINDING them in Fusion's
loaded material libraries and copying them into a design. Keeping the store free of
Fusion imports is what lets the list survive a library being renamed, re-imported or
temporarily unavailable — the name stays, the lookup simply comes up empty until the
library is back.

Names are matched case- and whitespace-insensitively. A decor is spelled
'K022 SN - Satin Blackwood' as a material and 'K022 SN - SATIN BLACKWOOD' as an
appearance in the very libraries this add-in reads, and no cabinetmaker should have
to care which one they typed.
