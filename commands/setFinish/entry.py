"""Set Finish — give a cabinet its finish spec in one shot.

Pick one or more cabinets (their top-level components) and say how each of the two
visible surface groups is finished:

  - **Carcass Type / Door Type** — Painted or Veneer. Written as attributes of
    exactly those names (config.WC_CARCASS_TYPE / WC_DOOR_TYPE) onto the components
    you selected, so a report can ask a cabinet how it is finished without having
    to look at any panel inside it.
  - **Carcass Material / Door Material** — a physical material from that
    dropdown's configured list. The command walks INSIDE each selected cabinet and
    assigns the carcass material to every component whose name is in
    config.WC_CARCASS_PART_NAMES (Left Panel, Shelf, Back Rail…) and the door
    material to every one in config.WC_DOOR_PART_NAMES (Door, Drawer Face, Filler…).
  - **Carcass Appearance / Door Appearance** — an appearance from that dropdown's
    own configured list, applied to the same two groups as a body-level override.

Every dropdown starts on "leave unchanged", and each is independent: set a material
without touching the look, recolour without re-specifying what the panel is made of,
do both at once, or neither and just tag the types.

Why names: the cabinet author already controls them — Carcass Maker and Shelf
Creator name what they build — so no extra tagging step is needed to tell a box
part from a front. Matching is case-insensitive and ignores Fusion's copy and
occurrence suffixes, so "Left Panel", "Left Panel (2)", "Left Panel:1" and
"left panel 2" are one and the same part. Alongside the exact lists there are
KEYWORD phrases (config.WC_*_PART_KEYWORDS): a component whose name merely CONTAINS
one joins that group, which is how every 'Drawer Face …' variant is caught without
enumerating them. Anything matching neither is left untouched: the command never
guesses, so hardware, worktops and your own custom parts keep whatever material you
gave them.

Where the dropdown contents come from: four curated lists in
commands/finish_store.py, one per dropdown, resolved against Fusion's loaded material
libraries (Emaar, Fusion Material, Assets, Favorites …) by commands/material_pool.py.
Separate lists per dropdown is the point — a carcass is MDF or melamine, a door front
is a decor, and the full libraries run to hundreds of entries. Edit the lists with
the **Finish Lists** command.

Material assignment writes BOTH the component's material and every solid body's
material, because that is the pair `panels.panel_material()` reads (a body-level
material wins over the component default) — anything less and the Cut List would
still report the old decor.

**Material and appearance are decoupled.** A physical material carries an
appearance, so assigning one normally drags that appearance along with it — setting
a panel's material to a walnut would repaint it walnut on screen. Set Finish
suppresses that: when no appearance is chosen it notes each body's current
appearance, assigns the material, then pins the old appearance back as an explicit
body override, so the material changes underneath and the viewport does not. When an
appearance IS chosen it becomes the override instead. What the panel is (what the
Cut List costs) and what it looks like stay two separate decisions you make
independently. A body that already carries its own appearance override needs no
protecting — an override outranks the material's appearance either way.

      - appearance chosen  → set it as an explicit body override once the material

class _ComponentSet:
    """"Have I already visited this component?" — the one question this command has
    to answer correctly, and the one that has bitten it repeatedly.

    Fusion's `==` on two Component objects compares the underlying entity, and it is
    the ONLY identity here that holds up. Everything cheaper is wrong on a real
    kitchen:

      - `id(comp)` (a Python address) — Fusion hands back a fresh wrapper every time
        you touch a component and the old one is garbage collected, so CPython
        recycles addresses and an untouched component inherits the identity of a
        freed one. Skips at random.
      - `entityToken` — not guaranteed to return the same string twice for one
        entity, and slow enough on a Component to stall Fusion outright.
      - `(owning design root name, component name)` — collapses configured library
        cabinets. A kitchen built from a configured library is full of DIFFERENT
        components all called 'Custom 1' or 'Left Panel'; measured on a real kitchen,
        this merged 176 genuinely distinct components down to far fewer and skipped
        whole cabinets.
      - `Component.id` — stable per component but NOT unique: two configured copies
        of one library part share it while being separate components that can hold
        different materials. Measured on the same kitchen, 51 of its id buckets
        mixed distinct components together.

    `==` is O(n) per lookup, so entries are bucketed by component name first and only
    compared within a bucket. A component's name never changes underneath us, so two
    wrappers for one component always land in the same bucket — the bucketing is
    pure speed, never a correctness assumption. Measured at 1469 component visits
    across a 17-cabinet kitchen: 0.01s.

    Holding the component objects also keeps them alive, which removes the wrapper
    churn that made the `id()` version unsafe in the first place."""
