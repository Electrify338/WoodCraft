"""Global add-on settings for WoodCraft — a tiny key/value JSON store.

Lives next to the stock-sheet library (same folder, see sheets_store.library_dir)
so all WoodCraft user data travels together. Settings are add-on-wide, not
per-design: they tune how reports are computed, not what the model contains.

Current keys:
    waste_percent — % added on top of a panel's raw area when estimating its
        cost from sheet prices in the BOM (nesting never uses 100% of a sheet,
        so a pure area × rate estimate would systematically undershoot).

New settings plug in by adding a key to DEFAULTS; load() overlays the file on
the defaults so older files simply pick up new keys. No Fusion API here — this
module is unit-testable with plain Python.
