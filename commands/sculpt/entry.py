"""Sculpt — cut selected panels using hardware accessory tool bodies.

Scans the assembly for hardware "tool" bodies (the hidden cut/hole bodies modelled
inside connectors, dowels, hinges, etc.), maps them into the root assembly context,
and Combine-cuts the selected panels with every tool that actually intersects them.
The tool bodies are kept intact so the hardware stays in the model.

A tool body qualifies if its name matches one of the filter terms (default
"cut, hole") OR — when "Scan hidden bodies" is on — its visibility lightbulb is
off. Panels and skeleton bodies are never used as tools.

Matching is two-stage: a cheap bounding-box overlap prunes obviously-disjoint
pairs, then a precise minimum-distance test confirms the solids really touch, so
hardware whose bounding box overlaps a panel but whose body does not is skipped.
