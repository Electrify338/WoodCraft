"""Edgeband — tag panel edge faces with an edgeband type for the BOM.

Pick the faces to band (a panel's thin edge faces — the 18 mm-wide strips) and
choose an edgeband from the Sheets library's band catalogue; each face is stamped
with a WC_EDGEBAND attribute holding the band's NAME. The BOM then sums the
tagged lengths per band type across the whole design (face area ÷ panel
thickness, so a curved edge counts its true arc length) and prices the metres
from the catalogue's cost per metre. Nothing but the name is stored on the face —
cost lives in the library, so re-pricing a band re-prices every past design.

Tagging also TINTS the face in the viewport: a design-local appearance named
after the band (colour = the band's library colour) is applied as a face
override, so banded edges read at a glance. Removing the tag clears the
override. The tint is cosmetic — the BOM reads only the attribute.

Bands are edited in the Sheets palette (same sheets.json file as the stock
sheets). The last dropdown entry removes an existing tag instead.
