"""Handles — fit one handle model to every cabinet in the kitchen, and swap it.

Pick a handle from the dropdown, press OK, and every locator point in every
cabinet's "Handles" sketch gets that handle. Pick a different one later and the old
handles come out first, so the dropdown behaves like a choice rather than an
accumulation — which is the whole point: a kitchen has ONE handle model, and
changing your mind should not mean deleting nine occurrences by hand.

Where the handles come from
---------------------------
The `Handles` folder of the `config.HARDWARE_PROJECT_NAME` cloud project — the same
library the Insert Hardware command reads, so a handle added to the project appears
here with no code change.

Where they go
-------------
Into the KITCHEN assembly's root component, not inside the cabinets. A handle is not
part of the cabinet's own design — the same cabinet takes a different handle in the
next kitchen — so it is placed alongside the cabinets and jointed to their sketches.
That also means swapping the handle never touches a cabinet component, so nothing
propagates back into the library.

The placement maths is the EmaarHandlesInsertion script's, which is already proven
against this library:

  - A marker is DRAWN geometry only. Fronts arrive in these sketches as projected
    edges, and projected geometry is never a marker — that is what stops a handle
    landing on an outline corner. Of the drawn vertices, the marker is the one that
    touches nothing else.
  - The handle runs along the edge of the front its marker springs from — up a door,
    across a drawer — and is stood upright when it comes out vertical.
  - It is centred on its point, then slid back along its own length if centring
    would run it off the end of that front, leaving HANDLE_EDGE_CLEARANCE_MM.
  - Nothing about the handle model is assumed; it is measured.

Each handle is RIGID-JOINTED to its marker with an ordinary joint — joint origin,
flip, angle, offsets — exactly as the script does it, so nothing is positioned by
transform and the handle is genuinely attached rather than floating at a coordinate.
The cabinets here are LINKED, though, so their own sketch points are read-only and
cannot carry a joint origin; each cabinet gets a native anchor of our own instead.
See the Jointing section.

What is different here is the SCOPE: the script fits nine handles in one cabinet
document; this fits one handle to every marker in a whole kitchen, which can easily
be forty of them across a dozen linked cabinets. Scope is what shapes the code —
the script could afford to measure and correct each handle in turn, and at kitchen
scale that costs minutes. So the work that is the same for every handle is done
once and only once:

  - the handle FILE is inserted once and copied thereafter (HandleProfile,
    _add_handle);
  - the handle MODEL is measured once, into numbers that are local to it and so
    true of every copy (profile_handle);
  - the way Fusion ORIENTS this handle on a front is calibrated once, and expressed
    in the anchor plane's own basis so it carries to cabinets facing any direction
    (Calibration, calibrate);
  - each cabinet's front FACE is found once and then settles which way is out,
    hosts the anchor sketch, and answers the containment probe.

Every handle after the first is then created already flipped, turned and slid into
place, in one shot, with no timeline edits — and the first handle on each cabinet is
measured against the prediction (check_fit), so the arithmetic is still checked
rather than trusted. A cabinet that fails the check falls back to the slow
measure-and-nudge loop (refine).

# one point per marker. Because the plane comes from the cabinet's own front face,
# the joint origin's primary axis lands on the front's normal, which is precisely
