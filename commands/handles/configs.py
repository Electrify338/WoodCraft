"""Switching a whole kitchen's cabinets between the Gola and Other Handles themes.

A Gola profile is not hardware you place — it is machined into the cabinet, so it
belongs to the cabinet's own configuration. Every other handle IS hardware, and
the cabinet has to be configured NOT to have a Gola profile before one is fitted.
So picking a handle is really two decisions, and this module makes the first one:
every base and tall cabinet in the kitchen is switched to the Handles theme that
matches what was picked, and only then does Fit Handles place anything.

Wall cabinets are left alone — WALL_PREFIXES — because they carry no Gola profile.

What costs time, measured
-------------------------
Almost everything about an occurrence is free to read. Two things are not, and
neither is cached by Fusion, so every access pays again:

    occurrence.configurationRow      ~3.0 s   EVERY time
    occurrence.configuredDataFile    ~0.8 s   EVERY time

Reading them once per cabinet is what made this take a minute on two cabinets.
So neither is read per cabinet any more:

  * The row NAME comes from `occurrence.component.name`, which is free and equal
    to it. It is checked against the library table, and only if it is not there
    does the slow property get read for that one cabinet.
  * The library DataFile is fetched once per LIBRARY, not once per cabinet. The
    first cabinet pays 0.8 s; every later cabinet whose row is in that library's
    table is known to belong to it and pays nothing.
  * Nothing is read at all for a cabinet already on the right theme, which is the
    common case when you are trying handles one after another.

Everything hangs off objects held from the one read: once you hold a row, its
name, its parent table and every row in that table are free.

Three more constraints shape the rest of it:

  * A cabinet's theme VALUES cannot be read from the kitchen at all. Every route
    answers "API Function not yet implemented", and having the library file open
    is not enough — only the configured design as the ACTIVE document will say.
    Activating an already-open document costs 0.23 s and reading its whole table
    a millisecond, so it happens ONCE per library file.
  * A row added to a library file is invisible to the kitchen until that file is
    SAVED, and a save costs about 25 seconds. So every row a run needs is created
    in one visit and committed in one save.
  * A placement is pinned to the library version it was inserted from. After a
    save it still sees the old table, and neither reopening the kitchen nor
    "Get All Latest Versions" moves it. The row has to come from
    `configuredDataFile.latestVersion.configurationTable`, and switching to one
    of those advances the reference as a side effect.
